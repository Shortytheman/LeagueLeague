I've used no other help than chatgpt for one of the methods:
OutputTable()

Which i have the whole chatlog for in chat/outputTable (It's a long read.)

I used Classes, properties, Exception, Arrays and collections and attributes. All present at the "Football.cs file"

Classes: lines 446, 456 and 470.
Properties: Lines 448 - 480 ~.
Exception: Lines 142, 157, 193, 222, 276 and 324.
Arrays: Lines 151, 171, 333 and 348.
Collections(Lists): Lines 5, 6, 19, 27, 43, 104, 207, 208, 238, 286, (418), 450, 451 and 452.
