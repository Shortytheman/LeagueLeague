I am fully aware and very sorry that i am handing in an unfinished product. The reason is that i found out way too late that i was allowed to work in groups and i had familiy stuff to do in easter, so i didnt use enough time on the assignment.

I did however learn alot about basic c# syntax and had an interesting conversation with chatGPT while making the assignment.

The "Football.cs" file is to be run, and it will automatically make a random tournament based on the inputs in the main method - i spent alot of time and brainpower just to make the .csv files auto generate, and got kinda overwhelmed when i had to read from them and process the data working alone.
